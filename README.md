# wasm-chrome-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for making chrome extensions with wasm generated by rust.

# Getting Started
1. Build the package. From the root directory, run
    ```
    wasm-pack build
    ```

2. Link for local development - this lib will not be published. From `./pkg`, run
    ```
    npm link
    ```
    Then, from ./www, run
    ```
    npm link rust-wasm-examples
    ```

3. To run in dev environment, again from `./pkg`, run
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
Then open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`. Click `Load unpacked`, and select the `~/www/dist` directory. When you open a new tab, you should see a list of buttons that use wasm-bindgen.

4. Alternatively, you can also run the app on a local server. Simply run
    ```
    npm run serve
    ```
and then go to `localhost:8080`.

# Remarks
Current set up is only for local development. A cleaner set up is coming soon.
